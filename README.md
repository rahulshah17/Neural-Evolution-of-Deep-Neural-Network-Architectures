# Neural-Evolution-of-Deep-Neural-Network-Architectures
Optimized CNN architectures for CIFAR-10 using evolutionary algorithms with lexicase and tournament selection. Achieved efficient models balancing accuracy, complexity, and runtime via genetic algorithms, multi-objective fitness evaluations, and Python libraries (DEAP, TensorFlow/Keras)
